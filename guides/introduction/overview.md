# Overview

## About

You are about to start an Elixir tutorial that will result in creating your very first app. The experience of learning a new technology will not always be filled with hearts and roses but probably it will be full of challenges, mistakes and reading tons of new things. Make sure to be patient with yourself, ask questions and experiment with your own ways of completing the guide. It is supposed to serve you as a set of guidelines and not become your one and only source of Elixir knowledge.

## Tools

Depending on where you are on your programming journey, here are some additional tools that you should consider installing.

### Text Editors

A text editor is the core of every developer's toolbox, that's why it's important to choose it wisely.

#### Visual Studio Code (Recomended)

[Installation instruction.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

Recommended extensions to the editor that will ease the development workflow.

- [LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) - Real-time collaborative development from the comfort of your favorite tools. Could help in pair programming with mentor during workshops.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - This is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
