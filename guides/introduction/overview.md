## Tools

Depending on where you are on your programming journey, here are some additional tools that you should consider installing.

### Text Editors

A text editor is the core of every developer's toolbox, that's why it's important to choose it wisely.

#### Visual Studio Code (Recomended)

[Installation instruction.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)

Recommended extensions to the editor that will ease the development workflow.

- [ElixirLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls) - Elixir support with debugger, autocomplete, and more.
- [LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) - Real-time collaborative development from the comfort of your favorite tools. Could help in pair programming with mentor during workshops.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - This is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- [Indenticator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SirTori.indenticator) - Visually highlights the current indent depth.

#### Alternatives

- [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com)
- [Textmate](https://macromates.com)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org) (not recommended for a begginers)
